# NBA Stats Visualizer & Predictor

A data science project that explores NBA player statistics, visualizes trends, and predicts player performance using machine learning.

## Motivation

I created this project to sharpen my end-to-end data analysis, visualization, and machine learning skills using real-world NBA data. The goal is to build an interactive dashboard for basketball fans and analysts.

## Features

- Download and clean NBA player stats
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization in Jupyter
- Machine learning model to predict points per game
- (Planned) Streamlit dashboard for interactive insights
