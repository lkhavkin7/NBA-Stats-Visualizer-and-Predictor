# NBA Stats Visualizer & Predictor

A data science project that explores NBA player statistics, visualizes trends, and predicts player performance using machine learning.


## Data

https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025_per_game.html


## Motivation

I created this project to sharpen my end-to-end data analysis, visualization, and machine learning skills using real-world NBA data. The goal is to build an interactive dashboard for basketball fans and analysts.

## Features

- Download and clean NBA player stats
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization in Jupyter
- Machine learning model to predict points per game
- (Planned) Streamlit dashboard for interactive insights

### Data Cleaning Notes

- Removed columns such as "awards" and "additional player info" due to low statistical significance and lack of impact on predictive modeling.

- For `.py` scripts:  
  Open in VS Code and click "Run" or use the terminal:
  ```
  python scripts/your_script.py
  ```
- For `.ipynb` notebooks:  
  Open in VS Code with the Jupyter extension for interactive code and visualizations.

5. **(Planned)** To launch the Streamlit dashboard:
